-- Q1: Total Revenue from Delivered Orders
-- Objective: Calculate total revenue from all successfully delivered orders.

SELECT 
    SUM(sale_price) AS total_revenue
FROM orders
WHERE status = 'Delivered';

--------------------------------------------------

-- Q2: Revenue by Product Category
-- Objective: Determine which product categories generate the most revenue.

SELECT 
    p.product_category, 
    SUM(o.sale_price) AS total_revenue
FROM orders o
JOIN product p ON o.productid = p.productid
WHERE o.status = 'Delivered'
GROUP BY p.product_category
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;

--------------------------------------------------

-- Q3: Top 10 Best-Selling Products by Sales Value
-- Objective: Identify the top 10 products that brought in the highest revenue.

SELECT TOP 10 
    p.product_name, 
    SUM(o.sale_price) AS total_sales
FROM orders o
JOIN product p ON o.productid = p.productid

-- Q5: Month-over-Month Revenue Trend (last 6 months)
-- Objective: Identify recent revenue trends and detect any seasonality.

SELECT 
    FORMAT(orderdate, 'yyyy-MM') AS month_year,
    SUM(sale_price) AS monthly_revenue
FROM orders
WHERE status = 'Delivered'
AND orderdate >= DATEADD(MONTH, -6, GETDATE())
GROUP BY FORMAT(orderdate, 'yyyy-MM')
ORDER BY month_year;

--Here as the latest date in the dataset is 31st DEC 2020
--so in general last 6 months from the current date will not give us the exact output, so
--to modify the question little bit , identify the last 6 month revenue trend from the latest year

"Since the dataset ends on 31st Dec 2020, using GETDATE() wouldnâ€™t give relevant results.
Instead, I dynamically anchored the last 6 months based on the MAX(orderdate) in the dataset.
I used > instead of >= to include exactly 6 full months, from July to December 2020."

-- Section 3: Product Returns and Rating Analysis
-- Questions Q11 to Q15
-- Focus: Return rates by category and product, top return reasons,
--        fulfillment success, and the relationship between ratings and returns
-- Note: Most queries focus on 'Returned' and 'Delivered' statuses.
--       Output is formatted using CAST/ROUND for clean readability.
-- -------------------------------------------------------

--Q11. Return Rate by Product Category
--Identify product categories with high return rates to investigate product quality or expectation gaps.

select p.product_category,
cast(Round(count(case when od.status='returned' then 1 end)*100.0/count(*), 2) as decimal(5,2)) 
as return_rate
from orders od
join product p
on od.productid=p.productid
group by p.product_category
order by return_rate;

-- Q11: Return Rate by Product Category
-- Objective: Identify product categories with high return rates
-- Note: Return rate = (Returned Orders / Total Orders) * 100
--Using CTEs for readability

with return_cte as(
select p.product_category, count(od.status) as return_orders

from return_cte join count_cte
on return_cte.Product_Category=count_cte.product_Category
order by return_rate desc;

--Comment
-- Used CTEs to split return and total orders for better readability
-- Applied CAST to format return rate percentage to two decimal places
-- Compared return orders against total orders for each category

--Q12. Top 5 Products with Highest Return Rate
--Spot individual products being returned frequently to review listing or QA.

select top 5 p.product_name, 
CAST(COUNT(CASE WHEN od.Status = 'Returned' THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*) AS DECIMAL(5,2)) 
AS return_rate
from orders od join product p
on p.productid=od.productid

--Q13. Top 5 Return Reasons
--Understand the most common reasons customers return products.
select top 5 Reason, count(*) as return_count
from orders
where status='Returned'
group by Reason
order by return_count desc;

--Using Coalesce to Handle Null values(avoid reason as Null)

select top 5 Coalesce (Reason,'Not mentioned') as Return_reason, count(*) as return_count

-- Section 4: Delivery and Operational Analysis (Q16 to Q20)
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------


-- Q16: Avg Delivery Time by Delivery Type
-- Objective: Identify average delivery timelines to assess SLA adherence

SELECT 
    delivery_type,
    AVG(DATEDIFF(DAY, orderdate, delivery_date)) AS avg_deliverytime_in_days
FROM orders
GROUP BY delivery_type
ORDER BY avg_deliverytime_in_days DESC;


-- Further Analysis: Return Rate for Each Delivery Type

SELECT
    delivery_type,
    CAST(
        COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'returned' THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*) 
        AS DECIMAL(5, 2)
    ) AS return_rate
FROM orders
GROUP BY delivery_type
ORDER BY return_rate DESC;


-- ðŸ“Œ Insight Summary (Q16 Extension):

-- Among the three delivery types, Shipped from Abroad had the longest 
-- average delivery time of approximately 15 days and also the highest 
-- return rate at 30.92%, making it a major operational red flag.
-- Despite being the fastest, Express delivery (avg ~3 days) showed a 
-- return rate of 26.38%, possibly indicating product quality issues or 
-- customer dissatisfaction.
-- Standard Delivery averaged ~9 days and had the lowest return rate 
-- (23.73%), making it the most balanced fulfillment method with 
-- optimization potential.


-- Q17: Delayed Deliveries Count (If Delivery > 5 Days)
-- Objective: Count and analyze delayed orders to reduce future delays

-- Method 1: Subquery
SELECT COUNT(*) AS delay_delivery 
FROM (
    SELECT DATEDIFF(DAY, orderdate, delivery_date) AS daysdiffcnt
    FROM orders
    WHERE DATEDIFF(DAY, orderdate, delivery_date) > 5
) delay_count;


-- Method 2: Simplified (Same Output)
SELECT COUNT(*) AS delay_delivery
FROM orders
WHERE DATEDIFF(DAY, orderdate, delivery_date) > 5;


-- Breakdown by Delivery Type (Optional Deep-Dive)
SELECT 
    delivery_type,
    COUNT(*) AS delayed_orders
FROM orders
WHERE DATEDIFF(DAY, orderdate, delivery_date) > 5
GROUP BY delivery_type
ORDER BY delayed_orders DESC;


-- Q18: Fastest and Slowest Zones (Average Delivery Days)
-- Objective: Identify zone-wise delivery efficiency or bottlenecks

SELECT 
    zone,
    AVG(DATEDIFF(DAY, orderdate, delivery_date)) AS avg_delivery_days
FROM orders
GROUP BY zone;


-- Q19: Product Categories with Highest Express Orders
-- Objective: Analyze which product types rely heavily on fast shipping

SELECT TOP 1 
    p.product_category,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN od.delivery_type = 'Express' THEN 1 END) AS express_count
FROM orders od
JOIN product p ON od.productid = p.productid
GROUP BY p.product_category
ORDER BY express_count DESC;


-- Q20: Delivery Type Preference by Zone
-- Objective: Determine the most preferred delivery method per zone

-- Method 1: Without Window Function (Simple Aggregation)
SELECT 
    delivery_type,
    zone,
    COUNT(*) AS delivery_count
FROM orders
WHERE status = 'delivered'
GROUP BY delivery_type, zone
ORDER BY delivery_count DESC;

-- Use Case: Visualize full breakdown of delivery preferences by zone


-- Method 2: With Window Function (Dense Rank)
WITH Ranked_zone AS (
    SELECT 
        delivery_type,
        zone,
        COUNT(*) AS delivery_count,
        DENSE_RANK() OVER (
            PARTITION BY zone 
            ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
        ) AS delivery_zone_rank
    FROM orders
    WHERE status = 'delivered'
    GROUP BY delivery_type, zone
)
SELECT * 
FROM Ranked_zone 
WHERE delivery_zone_rank = 1
ORDER BY delivery_count DESC;

-- Explanation:
-- DESC ensures the most-used delivery type gets rank 1 within each zone.
-- This helps identify delivery-type popularity at a zonal level for 
-- operational alignment.
