-- Q1: Total Revenue from Delivered Orders
-- Objective: Calculate total revenue from all successfully delivered orders.

SELECT 
    SUM(sale_price) AS total_revenue
FROM orders
WHERE status = 'Delivered';

--------------------------------------------------

-- Q2: Revenue by Product Category
-- Objective: Determine which product categories generate the most revenue.

SELECT 
    p.product_category, 
    SUM(o.sale_price) AS total_revenue
FROM orders o
JOIN product p ON o.productid = p.productid
WHERE o.status = 'Delivered'
GROUP BY p.product_category
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;

--------------------------------------------------

-- Q3: Top 10 Best-Selling Products by Sales Value
-- Objective: Identify the top 10 products that brought in the highest revenue.

SELECT TOP 10 
    p.product_name, 
    SUM(o.sale_price) AS total_sales
FROM orders o
JOIN product p ON o.productid = p.productid
WHERE o.status = 'Delivered'
GROUP BY p.product_name
ORDER BY total_sales DESC;

--------------------------------------------------

-- Q4: Total Orders and Revenue by Zone
-- Objective: Compare order volume and revenue across zones.

SELECT 
    o.zone, 
    COUNT(o.orderid) AS total_orders,
    SUM(o.sale_price) AS total_revenue
FROM orders o
WHERE o.status = 'Delivered'
GROUP BY o.zone
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;

--------------------------------------------------

-- Q5: Month-over-Month Revenue Trend (last 6 months)
-- Objective: Identify recent revenue trends and detect any seasonality.

SELECT 
    FORMAT(orderdate, 'yyyy-MM') AS month_year,
    SUM(sale_price) AS monthly_revenue
FROM orders
WHERE status = 'Delivered'
AND orderdate >= DATEADD(MONTH, -6, GETDATE())
GROUP BY FORMAT(orderdate, 'yyyy-MM')
ORDER BY month_year;

--Here as the latest date in the dataset is 31st DEC 2020
--so in general last 6 months from the current date will not give us the exact output, so
--to modify the question little bit , identify the last 6 month revenue trend from the latest year

"Since the dataset ends on 31st Dec 2020, using GETDATE() wouldnâ€™t give relevant results.
Instead, I dynamically anchored the last 6 months based on the MAX(orderdate) in the dataset.
I used > instead of >= to include exactly 6 full months, from July to December 2020."

SELECT 
    FORMAT(orderdate, 'yyyy-MM') AS month_year,
    SUM(sale_price) AS monthly_revenue
FROM orders
WHERE status = 'Delivered'
AND orderdate > DATEADD(MONTH, -6, (select max(orderdate) from orders))
GROUP BY FORMAT(orderdate, 'yyyy-MM')
ORDER BY month_year;

-- Note: All queries consider only 'Delivered' orders for cleaner insights
-- -------------------------------------------------------


-- Q6: Number of Unique Customers by Category
-- Objective: Understand customer engagement across product categories
-- Note: Filtered only 'Delivered' orders to ensure analysis is based on successful transactions.

    p.Product_Category, 
    COUNT(DISTINCT o.CustomerID) AS unique_customers
FROM Product p
JOIN Orders o
  ON p.ProductID = o.ProductID
WHERE o.Status = 'Delivered'

GROUP BY p.Product_Category, 
         CASE 
            WHEN o.Customer_Age < 20 THEN 'Below 20'
            WHEN o.Customer_Age BETWEEN 20 AND 29 THEN '20-29'
            WHEN o.Customer_Age BETWEEN 30 AND 39 THEN '30-39'
            WHEN o.Customer_Age BETWEEN 40 AND 49 THEN '40-49'
            ELSE '50+' 
         END
ORDER BY p.Product_Category, age_group;


-- Q8: Product Category Purchase by Gender
-- Objective: Analyze gender-based purchase behavior per category
-- Note: Only delivered orders included to avoid distortion by returns or cancellations.

SELECT 
    p.Product_Category,
    o.Customer_Gender,
    COUNT(*) AS total_orders
FROM Orders o
JOIN Product p
  ON o.ProductID = p.ProductID
WHERE o.Status = 'Delivered'
GROUP BY p.Product_Category, o.Customer_Gender
ORDER BY p.Product_Category;


-- Q9: Customer Zone-wise Category Demand
-- Objective: Understand regional trends in category purchases
-- Note: Only completed deliveries are considered to reflect true geographic demand.

SELECT 
    o.Zone,
    p.Product_Category,
    COUNT(*) AS total_orders
FROM Orders o
JOIN Product p
  ON o.ProductID = p.ProductID
WHERE o.Status = 'Delivered'
GROUP BY o.Zone, p.Product_Category
ORDER BY o.Zone, total_orders DESC;


-- Q10: Average Order Quantity per Category
-- Objective: Determine how much customers typically order per category
-- Note: Analyzed only delivered orders for an accurate average.

SELECT 
    p.Product_Category,
    ROUND(AVG(o.Order_Quantity), 2) AS avg_order_quantity
FROM Orders o
JOIN Product p
  ON o.ProductID = p.ProductID
WHERE o.Status = 'Delivered'
GROUP BY p.Product_Category
ORDER BY avg_order_quantity DESC;

-- Section 3: Product Returns and Rating Analysis
-- Questions Q11 to Q15
-- Focus: Return rates by category and product, top return reasons,
--        fulfillment success, and the relationship between ratings and returns
-- Note: Most queries focus on 'Returned' and 'Delivered' statuses.
--       Output is formatted using CAST/ROUND for clean readability.
-- -------------------------------------------------------

--Q11. Return Rate by Product Category
--Identify product categories with high return rates to investigate product quality or expectation gaps.

select p.product_category,
cast(Round(count(case when od.status='returned' then 1 end)*100.0/count(*), 2) as decimal(5,2)) 
as return_rate
from orders od
join product p
on od.productid=p.productid
group by p.product_category
order by return_rate;

-- Q11: Return Rate by Product Category
-- Objective: Identify product categories with high return rates
-- Note: Return rate = (Returned Orders / Total Orders) * 100
--Using CTEs for readability

with return_cte as(
select p.product_category, count(od.status) as return_orders
from orders od join product p
on od.productid=p.productid
where od.status='returned'
group by p.Product_Category),

count_cte as(select p.product_category,count(od.status) as ordercount from orders od
join product p on p.productid=od.productid
group by p.Product_Category
)
select count_cte.product_category,
CAST( (return_orders)*100.0/ordercount as Decimal (5,2)) as Return_rate 
from return_cte join count_cte
on return_cte.Product_Category=count_cte.product_Category
order by return_rate desc;

--Comment
-- Used CTEs to split return and total orders for better readability
-- Applied CAST to format return rate percentage to two decimal places
-- Compared return orders against total orders for each category

--Q12. Top 5 Products with Highest Return Rate
--Spot individual products being returned frequently to review listing or QA.

select top 5 p.product_name, 
CAST(COUNT(CASE WHEN od.Status = 'Returned' THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*) AS DECIMAL(5,2)) 
AS return_rate
from orders od join product p
on p.productid=od.productid
group by p.product_name
order by return_rate desc;

--Q13. Top 5 Return Reasons
--Understand the most common reasons customers return products.
select top 5 Reason, count(*) as return_count
from orders
where status='Returned'
group by Reason
order by return_count desc;

--Using Coalesce to Handle Null values(avoid reason as Null)

select top 5 Coalesce (Reason,'Not mentioned') as Return_reason, count(*) as return_count
from orders
where status='Returned'
group by Coalesce (Reason,'Not mentioned')
order by return_count desc;

--Q14. Compare Returned vs Delivered Count per Category
--Compare fulfillment success rate by category.

select p.product_category, 
count(case when od.status='delivered' then 1 end) as delivery_category_count,
count(case when od.status='returned' then 1 end) as return_category_count
from orders od join product p
on od.productid=p.productid
group by p.product_category;

--Q15. Rating vs Return Rate Relationship
--Check if lower ratings are linked to more returns for product improvement.

select rating,
case 
when rating < 3 then 'below avg'
when rating =3 then 'avg'
else 'above_avg'
end as rating_cat,
CAST(count(case when status='returned' then 1 end)*100.0/count(*) as decimal(5,2))as return_rate
from orders
group by rating,
case 
when rating < 3 then 'below avg'
when rating =3 then 'avg'
else 'above_avg'
end
order by rating desc;

--other method without categorizing

select rating,
CAST(count(case when status='returned' then 1 end)*100.0/count(*) as decimal(5,2)) return_rate
from orders
group by rating
order by return_rate desc;
