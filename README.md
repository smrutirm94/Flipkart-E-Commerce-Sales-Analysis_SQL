# Flipkart-E-Commerce-Sales-Analysis_SQL

**Flipkart Orders & Product Portfolio Project- Real-World Business Scenarios**

**1. Project Overview:**

This repository showcases 20 real-world business SQL problems solved using MS SQL Server, focusing on product, delivery, and customer behavior analytics. 
The goal is to simulate the problem-solving mindset of a Product or Data Analyst, not just write SQL.

**2. 📊 Problem Areas Covered**

Instead of repeating SQL, group the questions into business areas like:

- Customer Segmentation & Purchase Behavior (Q1–Q5)
- Product Demand, Age Group Trends, Zone Patterns (Q6–Q10)
- Fulfillment, Returns, Shipping Cost (Q11–Q15)
- Delivery Timelines & Operational Insights (Q16–Q20)
  
**3. 📁 What's Included in This Repo**
   
- `SQL_Business_Questions.sql` → All 20 SQL queries with comments
- `Delivery_Insights_Analysis.pdf` → Analytical deep-dive with observations and recommendations
- `README.md` → Project summary and business context

**4. 💡 Key Business Insights**

- Shipped from Abroad has the highest delivery time and return rate (~15 days, 30.92%), signaling a risk in customer retention.
- Express delivery is fast (~3 days) but still has a high return rate (26.38%) – suggesting potential quality concerns.
- Zone-wise analysis shows delivery efficiency differs significantly across regions.

**5. 🧠 Analyst Mindset**
This project focuses on:
- Asking business-driven questions
- Using CTEs, Subqueries, and Window Functions
- Identifying KPIs (delivery time, return rate, fulfillment %)
- Deriving actionable insights, not just solving queries

 **6. 📈 Future Enhancements**
 - Add 10 more advanced SQL questions (e.g., running totals, cohort retention)
- Visualize insights using Power BI and Python (Seaborn/Matplotlib)
- Map insights to product decisions (e.g., delivery model optimization)
